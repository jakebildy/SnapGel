# SnapGel
Open-source rapid gel imaging in the browser, developed with support from Prof. Anderson at UC Berkeley. Optimized for GelGreenÂ® nucleic acid dye.

# Getting Started

1. Put a blue filter over your phone flashlight for best results. The specifics don't matter, but ideally transparent enough for significant blue light to pass through. The better quality the filter, the better your images will turn out.

This was taken with blue plastic cut out of a $2.00 subject divider:

2. Go to https://jakebildy.github.io/SnapGel/ on your phone. Works best on Google Chrome.

3. Put your phone over the gel and take a screenshot when the camera focuses.

4. That's it!
