# Getting Started

1. Put a blue filter over your phone flashlight for best results. The specifics don't matter, but ideally transparent enough for significant blue light to pass through.

2. Go to https://jakebildy.github.io/SnapGel/ on your phone. Works best on Google Chrome.

3. Put your phone over the gel and press the button.

4. That's it!
